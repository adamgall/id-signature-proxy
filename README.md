  * `server.js`

### api/

`api/` is the container surrounding the rest of the application.

### config/

`config/` is a folder for constants and api-internal configuration.

### controllers/

`controllers/` contains files which are intended to execute upon specific API route calls.

### proxy/

`proxy/` is where application-specific business logic lives.

### routes.js

`routes.js` define routes that execute controller methods.

### server.js

`server.js` creates our HTTP server.
